## Project Goals

This project analyzes a dataset of 4,499 customers from a large Canadian bank, aiming to improve the effectiveness of their personal loan marketing campaign. The bank currently has a surplus of depositors (liability customers) but wants to increase its borrower (asset customer) base by targeting customers most likely to accept a personal loan offer.

Previous marketing campaigns achieved about a 10% conversion rate. The goal here is to design a customer segmentation strategy to identify high-potential customers, allowing the bank to focus its marketing efforts more efficiently and increase loan uptake.

The analysis uses data collected during a campaign held in Toronto, including customer demographics, financial behavior, and their associated financial advisors. By segmenting the customers based on key financial indicators and advisor relationships, this project seeks to provide actionable insights to boost conversion rates in future campaigns.
